# Crime Stats in South Africa

### Project Overview
This project looks at crime trends in South Africa using a dataset from Kaggle that covers the years 2011 to 2023. I found that contact crimes, like robbery and assault, are common in all provinces. This is mainly due to issues like economic inequality, social unrest, and high levels of violence. On the other hand, sexual offenses are lower, which might be due to underreporting and the stigma surrounding these crimes. Gauteng province has the most crime incidents because of its high population density, unemployment, and poverty levels. Based on these findings, I plan to recommend how to allocate resources and deploy law enforcement effectively in both high-crime and low-crime areas to improve public safety.
